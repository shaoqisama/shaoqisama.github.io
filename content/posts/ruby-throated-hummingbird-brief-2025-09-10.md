## At a Glance
- **Scientific Name**: *Archilochus colubris*
- **Family**: Trochilidae (Hummingbirds)
- **Size**: 2.8-3.5 inches (7-9 cm wingspan)
- **Conservation Status**: Low Concern with stable, increasing populations
- **Where to Find**: Eastern North America from southeastern Canada to Gulf Coast; gardens, woodland edges, meadows

## Meet the Ruby-throated Hummingbird

The Ruby-throated Hummingbird is a tiny emerald jewel that transforms ordinary gardens into magical theaters of precision flight. As the only breeding hummingbird in eastern North America, this remarkable bird performs aerial ballet with wings beating 53 times per second, creating the distinctive humming sound that gives the species its name. September marks one of nature's most incredible journeys - these diminutive athletes are preparing for their non-stop 500-mile flight across the Gulf of Mexico to Central American wintering grounds.

Despite weighing no more than a penny, Ruby-throated Hummingbirds exhibit extraordinary endurance and navigational abilities. Males, distinguished by their brilliant ruby-red throats that flash like polished garnets in sunlight, have already begun their southern migration by early September. Females and juveniles follow shortly after, some doubling their body weight with fat reserves to fuel their remarkable trans-Gulf journey.

## Identification

**Key Features:**
- **Male**: Brilliant metallic green back and crown, iridescent ruby-red throat (gorget) that may appear black in poor light, white breast, dark forked tail, and short straight black bill
- **Female**: Golden-green upperparts, whitish underparts with buffy flanks, white throat with possible dark streaks, rounded tail with white tips on outer feathers
- **Juvenile**: Similar to female but young males develop scattered red throat feathers by fall migration
- **Voice**: Soft chips and chatters; wings produce distinctive humming sound in flight; males make buzz-like sounds during territorial displays
- **Behavior**: Precise hovering ability, can fly backwards and sideways, aggressive territorial defense, rapid darting flight patterns

## Habitat & Distribution

**Where They Live:**
- Deciduous and mixed woodlands, especially forest edges and clearings
- Gardens, parks, orchards, and suburban areas with flowering plants
- Stream borders, meadows, and old fields with abundant nectar sources
- Prefer areas with mix of open space for foraging and trees for nesting

**Seasonal Movements:**
- Breed throughout eastern North America from Nova Scotia to Gulf Coast
- Complete long-distance migrants wintering from Mexico to Panama and Caribbean islands
- Fall migration begins in August, peaks in September, with most gone by October
- **Current seasonal status (September)**: Peak fall migration period with birds actively fattening and preparing for Gulf crossing

## Behavior & Diet

**Feeding:**
- Primary diet consists of flower nectar, especially red or orange tubular flowers like trumpet creeper, cardinal flower, and bee balm
- Consume small insects and spiders for protein, catching prey in mid-air or gleaning from spider webs
- Visit feeders with sugar water (1:4 ratio sugar to water)
- Feed every 10-15 minutes throughout daylight hours, visiting hundreds of flowers daily

**Social Behavior:**
- Males fiercely territorial, defending prime feeding areas with aggressive displays
- Perform spectacular U-shaped courtship dives with buzzing wing sounds
- Solitary except during brief mating encounters
- Males provide no parental care after mating

**Reproduction:**
- Breeding season: May through July, sometimes two broods
- Nest is tiny cup (2 inches across) made of plant down and spider silk, camouflaged with lichen
- Built 10-40 feet high on downward-sloping branch
- Clutch: 2 tiny white eggs, incubated 12-14 days by female only
- Nestlings fledge at 18-22 days

## Conservation & Population

**Current Status:**
- Stable population with increasing trends over past 50 years
- Global breeding population estimated at 36 million individuals
- Annual population surveys show steady growth from 1966-2019
- Climate change may affect migration timing and flower synchrony

**How You Can Help:**
- Plant native flowering plants that bloom at different times throughout the season
- Maintain clean hummingbird feeders with fresh sugar water
- Avoid pesticides that eliminate insect prey
- Support habitat conservation in both breeding and wintering grounds
- Participate in eBird citizen science by reporting sightings

## Seasonal Spotlight

**Right Now (September):**
September marks the peak of one of nature's most remarkable migrations. Ruby-throated Hummingbirds are currently in their pre-migration phase, frantically feeding to build fat reserves that will fuel their incredible non-stop journey across the Gulf of Mexico. Males have already departed breeding territories, while females and juveniles are following suit, some increasing their body weight by up to 40% for the arduous flight ahead.

During this critical period, these tiny birds enter a state of hyperphagia, feeding almost constantly during daylight hours. They seek out late-blooming flowers like jewelweed, cardinal flower, and fall asters, while also taking advantage of well-maintained feeders. Their metabolism shifts dramatically to convert nectar into fat stores concentrated around their flight muscles - a physiological marvel that enables a 3-gram bird to fly 500 miles without stopping.

This September journey represents the culmination of a successful breeding season and the beginning of an 8-month absence from North American gardens. By month's end, most Ruby-throated Hummingbirds will have departed for tropical wintering grounds, leaving eastern gardeners to await their return next April.

## Fun Facts & Fascinating Features

- **Gulf Crossing Champions**: Make non-stop 500-mile flights across Gulf of Mexico in 18-20 hours, an extraordinary feat for a bird weighing less than a nickel
- **Wing Beat Virtuosos**: Wings beat 53 times per second in normal flight, up to 80 times per second during courtship displays, creating figure-8 patterns invisible to human eyes
- **Memory Masters**: Remember the location of every flower and feeder in their territory, returning to productive food sources on precise schedules
- **Color Vision Superstars**: See ultraviolet spectrum and can distinguish more colors than humans, helping them locate the most nectar-rich flowers
- **Ancient Travelers**: Fossil evidence suggests hummingbirds have been making trans-Gulf migrations for over 22 million years, predating the formation of the Gulf Coast's current geography

## Photography & Observation Tips

**Best Times to See Them:**
- Early morning (6-8 AM) and late afternoon (4-6 PM) during peak feeding periods
- September migration offers excellent observation opportunities as birds concentrate at food sources
- Still, sunny mornings provide best lighting for photography

**Where to Look:**
- Gardens with red tubular flowers (cardinal flower, bee balm, salvia)
- Well-maintained hummingbird feeders, especially in wooded edge habitats
- Stream sides with native flowering plants
- Mixed woodland edges with clearings

**Photography Notes:**
- Use fast shutter speeds (1/2000s or faster) to freeze wing motion
- Position near reliable food sources for predictable behavior
- Maintain respectful distance to avoid stressing migrating birds
- Early morning light provides best illumination of iridescent plumage

## Similar Species

**Look-alikes and How to Tell Them Apart:**
- **Female Rufous Hummingbird**: Has rusty sides and rump, more western range (rare vagrant in East)
- **Female Anna's Hummingbird**: Larger, grayer underparts, limited to western North America
- **Female/immature Broad-tailed Hummingbird**: Broader tail, different wing sound, western species
